    <h2>House Blend Coffee</h2>
    <p style="width:50%">Coffee is consumed worldwide â€“ the industry ranges from the growth, production, and distribution. There are so many
    different blends, brands, and beans that it can be difficult to understand what can make each cup of coffee different
    from the other. A blend of coffee is the result of combining two different beans to produce different flavors and
    strengths. Blends are not standardized in the coffee industry, making it difficult to fully grasp the core differences
    between cups. In order to define a House Blend coffee, you must first understand the basic components of roasting
    coffee.</p>

    <h2>French Roast</h2>
    <br />
    <p style="width:50%">French roast is a bold and robust coffee variety known for its deep, rich flavor profile. This dark roast is achieved by
    allowing the coffee beans to roast for an extended period, resulting in a glossy, oily surface and a distinct smoky
    flavor. The intense heat transforms the beans, giving them a dark brown to nearly black color and a crisp, shiny
    appearance. French roast coffee is characterized by its low acidity, full-bodied texture, and prominent notes of
    bittersweet chocolate and caramel. This roast is popular among coffee enthusiasts who appreciate a strong and hearty
    cup, making it an excellent choice for those who enjoy a more intense and complex coffee experience.</p>
